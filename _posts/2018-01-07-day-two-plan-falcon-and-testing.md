## Lessons so far
Yesterday was a fruitful learning day. 

### Repo setup
Going through the repo setup has been very illuminating, and it's opened up for
me some of the 'meta' programming elements of python that I haven't really
dealt with before - so far I've been very much focussed on learning the core language constructs and applying them to algorithms from a more funtional sense, but real deployed software has constraints and python is no different.

I've still got to get my head around the Pipfile/requirements.txt/setup.py subtelties - and this discussion on Reddit has been useful: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3uzl2a/setuppy_requirementstxt_or_a_combination/

### Falcon
I think there will be a bit for me to figure out how to best structure web
services using Falcon (or indeed any framework), and at the moment I'm having a
little bit of 'buyers remorse' whether a more popular framework like Flask
would have been a better choice given the size of its community, but
considering I'm on day 2 now, it's probably a bit too early to second-guess
these things, and let's face it, it's not like Falcon is that obscure.

## Today's Plan
1. Finish off repo setup, and fork the work for future ease of use
2. Write some unit tests for the status-service
3. Update this page at the end of the day with progress - yesterday I added a
second post with the same date and it's shown out of order.
4. Re-config vim - it's now starting to get good for python, but some settings
like hard stop at 79 chars is interfering with writing markdown.
