## Site is moving

I'll be adding content from now on on my self-hosted wordpress site at [www.mc74.org](http://www.mc74.org) from now on.  The posts here will probably eventually get migrated, to the ICFP2017 topic on that site, at least the relevant ones anyway.

So head on over to [www.mc74.org](http://www.mc74.org)

I'll be posting there on various things beyond just this ICFP project, including things like:
* Software engineering and software architecture
* DevOps experiments
* Other projects as I do them
* Links to interesting articles and videos
