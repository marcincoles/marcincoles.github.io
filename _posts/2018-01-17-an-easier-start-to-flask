## An easier start to Flask

Yesterday's post for CYOA Presentations was a bit ambitious, probably as I as delirious from about 20 hours awake and somehow thought all problems were no problems.

So I'm actually going to use the [flaskr tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/tutorial/introduction/) instead which is much smaller, and something that I can then practice some deployment with. 

Let's hope I don't change my mind again ;-p
