I've decided to call this blog:
## Re-engineering the product manager

This probably sounds more dramatic and feature-rich than it will ultimately end up being, but the aim is to document my own re-education into something we'll be able to call engineering - software and computer systems engineering.  

It is **not** going to be about re-engineering the product management process or the role of the product manager.  Product role functions on financial, operations, legal, etc issues are really the core of the job and it's a waste of the product manager's time to be solving low-level technical problems.  But sometimes, that's just what you like to do.

I've been in product management for a while now, and I do love how it is the great switch in the middle of the network - be it sales, partners, marketing, or engineering - it all comes through here.  But over time, the one thing that really changes if you don't pay attention is the technology, and your ability to understand and use it in anger.  Ironically, the proliferation of software toolkits to make life easy, actually put up a barrier to casual entry, so a forceful approach is required.

And this is where I'm going.  I want to solve technical problems again.  So I plan to document how I acquire the knowledge again (not just theoretical, but practical) in the technology areas that I find interesting.  At this stage, the early parts of the map are already fairly clear in where I need to focus, including:
1. Practical software development.  I've quickly fallen in love with **python** so that's going to be my go to in general.
2. Software development process, including SCM, DevOps orchestration, cloud implementation and the like.  Get opinionated on something that works, even just for me.  Try out various tools such as AWS CodePipeline vs CodeShip and see how they differ.
3. Learn Linux and cloud depoloyment (which let's face it are pretty well correlated) together with new advances in containers and their orchestration. This will take some time, but even simple things like getting familiar with **Vim** and configuring local (desktop) environments and moving onto hosted playgrounds.

### The Project
All of the above is how I presently perceive the initial bits of knowledge I'm going to acquire.  However, I need a project, and to begin with I'm going to create an entry for the [2017 ICFP Programming Competition][icfp-2017] which of course has finished now, but can be replayed.  I'll be able to practice python, processes and tools, programme design and development of algorithms (incl 'AI') for the solution space. A substantial part of the documentation here will relay this project's progress.
