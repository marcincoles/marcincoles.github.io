## The trouble with personal projects
...is that no one except you is managing the scope, and if the objective is to 'learn stuff' that scope becones hard to keep under control.  for exaample, I've spent a good part of my learning time the last couple of days learning about docker. in some ways that aligns with my ngoal to get hands-on experience with DevOps tools of the trade, but equally it may not be so important _right now_. 

On the plus side, I've been reading Introduction to Graph Theory by Richard Trudeau, which is exactly what I should be doing for the ICFP contest.

And then I read about Tensorflow...
