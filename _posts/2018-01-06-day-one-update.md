# A decent start
Pretty productive today, although it's certainly a case of the more you try to
do the more you realise how much there is still to learn.

### Python
Python is great and all, and it's a joy to program in, but as I've been going
through setting up the project, all the dependency management and structure
required is getting a bit daunting.  Like what's with:
* Pip and Pipfile, vs
* requirements.txt vs
* setup.py

I think I get it but that's a lot of scaffolding with various duplication
items. After going through this first one to understand what's inside all the
boxes, I'll fork Keith's repo for myself for future use.

### Falcon
For straightforward API services, like what I'm doing right now, falcon seems
to be easy enough to use, but having only really done one tutorial so far, and
pretty static one at that, time will tell how much complexity needs to be built
in considering it's so light weight in abstraction.

### Swagger
I haven't done anything there yet except a bit of reading, and a little bit of
api description on the project's README.  The repo is at
https://github.com/marcincoles/status-service.

#### Break time
Brain is a bit fried now, so I think I'll treat myself to some i3wm tweaking -
the colours are a bit too drab for now.
